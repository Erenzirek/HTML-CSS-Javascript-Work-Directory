    <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

        <h1 id="title">This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>
            When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare
                for
                web
                developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single
                page,
                became a long and expensive process.

                To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

                CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
